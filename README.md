## 3-challenge

# Description

- This project was built to create a random password generator using lower, upper, special and numeric characters. 

- During this project, starter code was already given and I added for loops, if statements, and defined all the variables. 

- I learned the process of starting Javascript. For instance, you have to spend a great deal of time creating an outline of what you'd like your code to do, before you write any code.
